            <p>
                China got Independence in 1 October 1949, China was not rich from the
beginning. It took time to china to appear on the world economy.
            </p>
            <p>At the time when Japan and Hong Kong giving competition to European
                countries in technology, The Chinese people struggling with a shortage of
                food supplies, cheap clothing, inadequate housing. And the service sector
                was also so poor, all of these things embarrassed china globally.</p>
            <strong>So, How did China Develop?</strong>

            <h2>How did china become manufacturing hub for the world?</h2>
            <p>In 1978, Chinese Economic reform came into existence by, China&#39;s
                paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping. He started the idea of “Socialism with
                Chinese Characteristics”. It allows private businesses, private ownership,
                and introduced a dual price system in which state-owned enterprises could
                sell products at a higher market price after a government planned quota was
                reached .</p>
            <p>For the first time after Independence, the country is open to investment
                through the establishment of special economic zones. Mr. Deng introduced
                many reforms such as large scale privatization of state owned-enterprises to
                a large extent, Mr. Deng’s plan has been a success. Over the past four
                decades, China has achieved the fastest sustained expansion by a major
                
                economy in history. China&#39;s gross domestic products have risen at the speed
                of 10X.</p>
            <p>And become the world&#39;s second-biggest economy, China has lifted more
                than 800 million people out of poverty.</p>
            <p>In today&#39;s world, China is the first preference for establishing its
                manufacturing units, Apple, Microsoft, Canon, Samsung and Sony are some
                of them.</p><br>

            <h2>How China Is Becoming Self Dependent In Every Field?</h2>
            <p><em>China</em> has manufactured almost everything for the world but still,
                China is not 100% self-dependent. But the scenario is changing very
                fast pace. China is moving towards manufacturing each and everything
                that uses in Chinese products. From microchips to aircraft everything.
                They are running so many mega projects to achieve their goal.</p><br>
            <h3>
                Can China produce its own high end chip?
            </h3>
            <p>Let’s find out: China spends more than 230 billion dollars in a year for
                importing microchips, even more than it spends on petroleum and it is
                China’s largest imports.</p>
            <p>In 2016, China made more than 1.2 billion smartphones and became
                the world&#39;s largest producer &amp; consumer of mobile phones but the
                crucial chips on which the phones run all have to be imported but the
                scenario is changing. China is building the fastest 5G chips and the size
                of this chip would be half of one square centimeter, It is consists of 1
                to 10 billion transistors, The team is working on it very efficiently and
                soon they will be able to do so.</p>

                    Can China produce its own Aircrafts?
                </h3>
                <p><em>Aviation Industry:</em> China has very busy skies and will be busier, there
                    are currently 3000 aircraft flying more than 1.33 passengers every day.
                    Most of these aircraft are manufactured in Europe or America but it is
                    set for a gradual change. The expansion of China&#39;s internal aviation
                    market over the next 20 years will see the number of civil aircraft
                    needed to rise over 6000. This huge market has prompted Chinese
                    engineers to design and build C919. It takes more than one million
                    components to build a c919 and each must be made to the highest
                    standard demanded by the world aviation industry.</p>
                <p>After the extensive testing in-flight stimulator (Iron Bird), the c919&#39;s
                    flight control system achieves a faultless level performance on its first
                    real test flight, in the future, c919 will be a key part of the Chinese air

                    manufacture will support more than 200 enterprises and 200000
                    skilled workers in the research and development. It has taken just 30
                    years for China to transform from an industrial backwater to the
                    world&#39;s largest manufacturer.</p><br>

                <h3>Can China produce its own Mega Container Ships?</h3>
                <p>Chinese shipyard is 399 meters long, it will rank with the biggest in the
                    world when fully loaded with containers it can sail for 40 days
                    uninterrupted. This is the first time a container ship of this size with a
                    capacity of 20,000 standard containers has been built in China. For
                    Engineers precision is the greatest challenge in building this giant, they
                    must work in all areas to a margin of error of fewer than 5 millimeters.
                    The heart of the shipyard is this giant dock, the size of seven football
                    fields. The dock is the yard&#39;s most valuable resource so efficiency
                    dictates that each vessel should occupy it for the shortest possible
                    time to speed the building process the various section of the ship are
                    put together in modules away from the main dock. The original design
                    of the ship splits it into 399 units for modules that can be assembled
                    separately and simultaneously at various sites around the yard.
                    These are then brought together for final assembly in the dock.</p>
                <p>Although broken down into 399 modules each weighs many dozens of
                    tons and moving them around is not easy, One of the largest modules
                    the bridge and superstructure is ready to be hoisted into position, it
                    weighs over 600 tones, it will be lifted by two huge gantry cranes that
                    themselves weigh 1,200 tons in total, the real difficulty is not in the
                    lifting but how to install it on the deck to the nearest millimeter it
                    requires the precise coordination of dozens of skilled workers.
                    In a few months’ time the Ship will plow across the oceans loaded with
                    the treasures and trinkets affordable goods that have benefited
                    people from Atlanta to Zanzibar.</p><br>

                <h3>Can China Generate its own Power?</h3>
                <p><strong>China </strong>consumes nearly 6 trillion kilowatt-hours of power per year to
                    provide this by thermal power plants alone it will put huge pressure on
                    
                    the environment and reduction of carbon emission is a key goal under
                    the Paris climate agreement 2016 so the nuclear power is one way to
                    achieve this while keeping the lights on. Though nuclear power has
                    zero carbon emissions it does have other major safety issues, the
                    engineers building China&#39;s new nuclear power stations must ensure
                    safety cannot be compromised.</p>
                <p>The 10,000 square meter factory in Shanghai is making the latest
                    generation of nuclear power units by the highest safety standards in
                    the world. The factory can build the equipment to fit out six nuclear
                    power plants per year if all are put into operation annual coal
                    consumption will reduce by at least 13.8 million tonnes.
                    At the same time, a wide range of projects is being undertaken to
                    provide diverse energy sources China&#39;s manufacturing industry is
                    reliant upon.</p><br>

                they design robots for a variety of different roles, they will be at the
                cutting edge of the production lines of the future. The robotics
                industry in China is expanding by 20% year-on-year. A new production
                line comes into service its robots building robots, a master robot
                selects the designated parts on the shelf and transfers the parts to
                their correct positions on the flow line through automatic guided
                vehicles AGV then robots arms assemble the parts. A new robotic era
                is on the way.</p><br>

            <h3>Can China create its own GPS system?</h3>
            <p>Our modern world has become reliant on global positioning satellites
                for almost every activity whether, for commerce or pleasure land, sea,
                and air all are equally indebted to the service. China is planning on
                expanding BeiDou with another 35 satellites over the next 2 decades.
                
                The potential of the BeiDou navigation satellite system is continuously
                increasing, shortly wherever you are no matter day or night you and
                your smartphone will be under its watchful eye.</p>

            <h3>Can China make its own high-speed railway system?</h3>
            <p>The train is a part of a new series of high-speed trains called Fùxīng
                (复兴) which literally means rejuvenation.</p>
            <p>In a few weeks, this new series of high-speed trains will take to the
                tracks for real as the world&#39;s fastest, journey time between Beijing to
                Shanghai will be cut to 4.5 hours as the rejuvenation series roll-out
                across the whole network. China will usher in a new high-speed era.
                in Chongqing city, northeast China, the birthplace of China&#39;s heavy
                industry a brand new factory has been commissioned the first batch of
                the rejuvenation series is being assembled they are wider, taller and
                longer than the previous generation of high-speed trains but their
                energy consumption is 15% lower the trains are manufactured to
                uniform standards trains of the same time produced by the other
                factories will all be compatible with each other even their components
                are compatible which will help reduce running costs.</p>
            <p>China has the world&#39;s most complex natural environment the new
                trains will face extreme cold, heat, and sandstorms amongst other
                challenges.</p>
            <p>China has 60% of the world&#39;s high-speed track which has carried more
                than seven billion passengers, with higher efficiency, longer service
                life, and higher energy efficiency China&#39;s high-speed trains are
                beginning to become the new standard for high-speed train travel.</p>

            <h3>Can China Compete for the World In Clothing
                Industry?</h3>
                <p>Even the most traditional manufacturing industry in China is
                    undergoing its own information revolution, everything looks the same
                    at a distance skilled workers, exclusive fabrics, and traditional
                    machines but the appearance deceive.</p><br>
                <p><em>Ms. Liu Yili left her job with a world top 500 company to come and
                    work in China for two years ago.
                    She said: Today, we can make personalized products based on data.</em></p>
                <br>
                <p>Weaving machines were key to the industrial revolution in the 18th
                    and 19th centuries, automation reduces the cost of textile production
                    after Henry Ford invented the assembly line, and manufacturing
                    became even more efficient tens of thousands of products can be
                    produced quickly and uniformly, manufacturing cost further dropped
                    but at the same time individuality was lost.</p>  
                <p>But the situation is changing now each outfit produced in this Chinese
                    factory is tailored to an individual customer.</p>
                <p>Data is what drives this every order goes into the computer system
                    from the internet and the system generates it as an independent code,
                    this code will guide workers on the production line. Although the 300
                    production steps are the same the codes direct the machinists as to
                    the different materials and production methods.</p><br>
                <p><em>Ms. Liu Lili (Manager of the garment factory) states that: &quot;On a
                    production line, we can produce thousands of different products, for
                    example, Men&#39;s wear, Children&#39;s wear. We can do all of these on a
                    single production line&quot;.</em></p><br>
                <p>Ten years ago the clothes turned out on this line were mass-produced
                    now they are individually customized and tailored to each client each
                    order will be turned around in a week, inventory stock is a thing of the
                    past. This is bespoke tailoring for the mass market, everything has
                    
                    changed and yet is somehow the same just better, faster and more
                    efficient.</p>

                <h2>Nutshell</h2>
                <p>
                    A new way of manufacturing is coming more and more devices are
connected to the internet, robots respond directly to incoming orders
the emphasis is moving from a pure speed of reaction to
speed+quality. This is the new made in China, a future of intelligent
manufacturing, this is the future on which China is staking its industrial
dream. China has already announced “Made In China 2025” With it,
China aims to move away from being the &quot;world factory&quot; (producing
cheap, low-quality goods due to lower labor costs) and move to
produce higher-value products and services.
